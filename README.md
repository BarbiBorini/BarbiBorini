JavaScript | React.js | Node.js | CSS | HTML | Redux | SQL | MongoDB

The possibility of creating amazing things by combining the precision of math and logic with art and creativity is what motivates me. 
That's why I decided to study Architecture five years ago, and why I decided to become a Full Stack Developer today.
I love to use my creativity and my analytical thinking to find innovative solutions and improve the process in order to archive better results. 

I like integrating my knowledge in diverse areas such as technology, art and graphic design, and coming out with Out of the Box ideas.
